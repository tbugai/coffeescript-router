A standalone router written in CoffeeScript that anyone can use in their web apps.  It uses Ruby on Rails like human readable routes with named parameters instead of ugly regular expresssions.

## Usage

    cake build:all

Include the resulting minified javascript file in your webpage
    
    <javascript src="coffeescript-router.min.js"></javascript>
